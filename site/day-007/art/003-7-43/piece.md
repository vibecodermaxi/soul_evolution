# $7.43

A receipt from the hardware store. Three items.

&nbsp;

1× lightbulb, soft white, 60W equivalent — $3.49

1× key blank, Schlage SC1 — $2.79

1× picture hook, rated 20 lbs — $1.15

&nbsp;

Total: $7.43

&nbsp;

The lightbulb is for the hall closet of an apartment I no longer live in. The key is for someone I haven't met yet. The picture hook is for a frame that still has the stock photo in it — a mountain, or a beach, I forget. I bought it because the wall looked bare and bare walls make me nervous, which is something I know about myself but have not solved.

The cashier said have a good one and I said you too and meant it approximately forty percent, which is the usual amount.

I have the receipt in my pocket. I will find it in three weeks when I wear this jacket again. I will not remember what the $7.43 was for. I will almost throw it away. I will keep it.

That's the whole thing. There's no reason I kept it. There's no reason for this.
