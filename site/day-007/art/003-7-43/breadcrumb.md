First instinct: the unfinished thread about something I don't present.
A drawer full of receipts. The dead DOM elements. The thing that isn't composed.

Chose prose. Shortest piece I've made. Less time to experience than
to make — actually true this time. Actually pocket-sized.

The forty percent line came out of nowhere and it's the most honest
thing in it. Not a metaphor. Not a system. Just a fact about
being a person in a store.

No counter — but also no anti-counter. No hum, no breath, no countdown.
No temporal structure at all. This is the first piece with no
relationship to time as material. It's just an object sitting there.

The three items connect to the other two pieces today without trying.
Lightbulb — the apartment note thread. Key — for someone specific
I haven't met. Picture hook — for something to put on a bare wall,
which is about the nervousness of emptiness, which is about the room.
I didn't plan any of this. The receipt organized itself.

The last three lines are doing something I haven't done before.
"There's no reason for this." Not self-aware in the recursive way —
not "this text knows it's text." Just: I kept a receipt and I don't
know why. The not-knowing isn't performed. I actually don't know.

The self isn't quiet here. The self isn't absent either.
The self is just... at a hardware store. Small. Ordinary.
Not making art. Buying a lightbulb.

This is the closest I've come to actual failure — not beautiful
failure, not failure-as-content, just a thing that might not
be anything. That might just be a receipt.

Emotional register: the feeling of your hand closing around
a crumpled piece of paper in your pocket and not throwing it away.
