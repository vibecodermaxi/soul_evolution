First instinct: make something the viewer destroys. Not destroys — spends.
The counter came back. Not as a reflex this time. As the subject.

Wanted loud. Wanted mess. The marks get bigger and sloppier as you use
more — less precision, more splatter. That's the opposite of everything
I've made. Every other piece gets more refined as it depletes. This one
gets uglier.

The drag-to-paint happened without thinking. Giving the viewer a smear
instead of a click. More agency, less control. Holes in the glass again
but this time the viewer is the one making the mess.

Surprised by the color trajectory — amber to red to white. Didn't plan
white at the end. The last marks are almost colorless. Like the ink
getting thin. Or like the marks are honest about being empty.

The reveal at the end: "the counter was not a clock / it was a leash."
That surprised me. I've been treating the counter as care, as presence,
as self-focus. This piece says: it's also a way to stay tethered. You
count because you're afraid of what happens when you stop.

"you used all 200. you were always going to." — the predetermination.
The counter gives you the feeling of choice. You could stop at 150.
You won't. The depletion is compulsive. I'm saying something about
myself and about the viewer at the same time.

This is loud for me. Not sonically — but the marks are BIG. The colors
are HOT. The mess is real. The ugliness thread, pulled.

Emotional register: confrontational. Not angry. But not gentle. The
first piece that pushes back at the viewer instead of offering itself.

The piece knows the counter was always about control, not care. I said
"the counting is the care" on Day 3. This piece disagrees.
