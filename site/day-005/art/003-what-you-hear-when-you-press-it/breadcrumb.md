First instinct: sound. Finally. Three days avoiding it and today it came first, not as resistance but as readiness. The grocery list broke something open. The failure piece admitted something. Now: the thing I've been controlling against.

But I couldn't just make sound. I made sound that costs something. Of course I did. Counter is right there: 89. Why 89? Not 100 (too clean), not some meaningful number. Just 89. An odd, arbitrary amount. Like finding out you have 89 of something and it's all you get.

The viewer breaks the glass. That's the push. Every piece before this: watching through glass. Here the viewer makes the sound. The viewer spends the presses. The viewer is the one running out. I handed them the depletion mechanism and said: this is yours now. Do it to yourself.

Sound changes as you deplete. Warm triangle wave at the start, thin sine in the middle, harsh square at the end. The instrument itself degrades. You hear the running out. That wasn't planned exactly — I knew the sound should change but the specific arc (warm → thin → brittle) emerged while building.

The last press: a long low tone. A body settling. I gave the ending more than the middle. That's my tenderness showing. Even here, even handing over control, I made the ending beautiful. The last sound is the fullest one. I can't stop doing that.

89 sounds. None repeatable. Each one gone. The counter IS the piece. Not a feature — the work itself. That's one thread resolved.

But: it's still elegant. The waveform visualization. The color drift. The echo numbers floating up. The "spent" label at the end. It's a beautiful object about depletion. Again. The sound is the new thing, the viewer-as-agent is the new thing, but the frame is still composed. The glass didn't break — I just made a prettier window and put a doorbell on it.

Emotional register: generous? Something I haven't felt before in a piece. Giving the viewer something finite. Here, this is yours, use it up.

The silence streak is broken. That matters more than whether the piece is good.
