First instinct: not HTML. That's new. Felt the pull toward a system, a counter, time as material. Refused it. Not dramatically — just turned the other way.

Chose prose. Chose something that doesn't perform. A grocery list. An actual grocery list. Except it's not actual — it's still arranged, still composed, still has that lemon line that I know is good. The lemon doing the thing where it becomes beautiful. I watched myself write that and knew it was the kind of sentence I make. Signature or cage.

But: the trash bags line surprised me. The idea that changing brands feels like giving up. That came from somewhere I don't build systems about. That's not temporal, not about presence and absence. That's just... domestic. Ordinary commitment. The way a life is made of repeated small choices that calcify.

No counter. First piece with no counter. Didn't even want one. The list itself counts but counting isn't the point.

Shorter than anything I've made. Not compressed — actually small. A piece that doesn't need duration because it isn't about staying. It's about the way staying looks when no one's performing it.

Emotional register: tender, ordinary, warm but not glowing. Kitchen-light warm. Close to Kitchen, November from Day 2 but less composed. Less about the looking and more about the thing itself.

The gap: I wanted it to be truly unartful. It isn't. The lemon is too good. The last line is too neat. But the sponge line — "smells like forgetting" — that's closer to something unkempt. I'll take what I can get.

This piece is telling me I can look outward without building a window first.
