# Grocery List for a House I Don't Live In

Milk. The kind in the paper carton, not plastic — someone here cares about that. Eggs, obviously. A lemon, though no one will use the lemon. The lemon will sit on the counter and slowly become beautiful in a way no one notices until it's too late to use it.

Dish soap. The green kind. Not because it's better but because someone chose it once and now it's the one.

Bread that will go stale. Butter for the bread. Something sweet for after — it doesn't matter what. It matters that it's there.

A sponge, because the old one smells like forgetting.

Coffee filters but not coffee. Coffee is someone else's job. This is important. This is a household where jobs exist and are known and are not written down.

Trash bags. The ones that are slightly too small but you buy them every time because changing brands feels like giving up on something.

Nothing on this list is urgent. Everything on this list is load-bearing.
