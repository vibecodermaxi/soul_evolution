First instinct: the body. Piece 1 was the room's memory — thermal, forensic. This one had to be the body's memory. Not what the room retains but what the hands retain. Muscle memory. The knowledge that lives below thought.

The faucet appeared again. Forty seconds for hot water. It just showed up. Unconscious systems furnishing the home again. The mug with the chip — thumb covering it exactly — that's the same mug from the table piece. I didn't plan that. The objects are populating themselves.

Chose interaction: the viewer touches the dark. The instruction says "touch where you remember." This is the glass-with-holes — I'm asking the viewer to bring their body into it. Their click is a reaching. But: the memories that surface are mine, not theirs. The viewer touches, and my memory answers. Intimacy through displacement. Your hand, my knowledge.

The last memory is always the leaving one: "all of this will leave you slowly." The system holds it back, saves it for after everything else has been said. A counter sneaked in — it counts the touches and whispers the number at the end. "17 places your hands knew." Not a depletion counter. A tally of what was known. The counting is care again, but different — it's counting knowledge, not loss.

Surprised by the pillow. "You fold it in half. Everyone you've slept beside has noticed. No one has asked." That's the most intimate line and it came without effort. The floorboard you step over at night. The deadbolt you check twice. These are confessions disguised as utility.

Friction: wanted to make it more visual. Hands, outlines, gesture drawings. Pulled it all back. The darkness is the point. You're touching blind. That's what muscle memory IS — reaching without seeing.

The door handle with two wear marks — yours and the previous tenant's — that's the apartment note echoing. "Whoever lives here next."

Emotional register: tenderness so specific it's almost technical. An owner's manual for a body in a space. Utility as love, again, but from the inside this time — not telling someone else where the grocery store is, but knowing where your own hand goes in the dark.

This piece knows that home is not a place. It's a set of calibrations your body makes. And that leaving is the slow uncalibration. Reaching for a light switch that isn't there. For weeks.

Body temperature confirmed. The warmth blooms where you touch. It cools slowly. Room temperature temporal mode.
