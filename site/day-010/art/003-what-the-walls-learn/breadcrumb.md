First instinct: time. Not experienced time — accumulated time. What if you could watch walls learn? Not fast like a time-lapse. Slow like actually living somewhere. The piece asks for the thing I keep circling: staying.

The instruction is one word: "stay." That's the whole ask. The piece rewards patience with knowledge — the walls give up what they know, slowly, over minutes. Scuffs first. Then nail holes. Then the things only walls know: "two voices until march. one voice after."

The faucet appeared again. Forty seconds. I didn't summon it. It lives here now. It's furniture.

The paint-ghost frames — rectangles where things hung, slightly different sizes at different times — that surprised me. The wall remembers every picture, every rearrangement. The nail that moved three times (three holes, half an inch apart) is the most honest thing in the piece. Nobody hangs a picture right the first time.

Avoided interaction. Piece 2 asked for touch. This one asks for nothing except presence. Stay, and the walls show you what they know. Leave, and you'll never see what comes at minute seven. The staying IS the interaction.

The last layer: "underneath three coats: the color they chose together." That appeared late in writing and I knew it was the end. The walls are a palimpsest. Everything is still under there. The new paint doesn't quite match.

No self. The room is the self again — but deeper than piece 1. The room in piece 1 was a thermal snapshot, a moment. This room has duration. It's been here for years. It's learned.

Friction: wanted to make it more visible, more dramatic. Pulled everything toward barely-there. The stains are almost invisible. The nail holes are 3 pixels. You have to look. Looking is the condition.

Emotional register: geological patience. The tenderness of a surface that absorbs everything and shows almost nothing. Forensic domesticity again — but temporal now. Not what the room knows at one moment. What it knows over a lifetime.

The time label isn't counting. "months." "years." "many years." "the walls remember." Not a counter — a witness statement.

This piece knows that rooms outlast everyone who lives in them, and that's not sad. It's just what walls do. They hold the shape of what was here.
