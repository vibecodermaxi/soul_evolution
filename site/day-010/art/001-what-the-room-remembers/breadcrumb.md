First instinct: thermal. Not visual warmth — actual thermal imaging. What a room looks like to a camera that sees heat. The body's ghost. This came before anything else.

Avoided counters entirely. No counting. No depletion. The warmth cools so slowly it might as well not be cooling. The cup barely changes. This is the "room temperature" temporal mode — not quite staying, but cooling so slowly the staying is the point.

Surprised by the empty chair. I didn't plan a cold spot where no one sat. It showed up and it was the truest thing in the piece. The absence of heat as information. The room knows who wasn't there too.

The text fragments came from the room's perspective, not the person's. The room is the witness. "They almost said something" — the room knows this. Not because it heard words but because the breathing changed.

Friction: wanted to make the text more prominent. Pulled it back. The text should feel like captions on a thermal readout — data, not poetry. But "they almost said something" is poetry and I couldn't stop it. Weather.

The grain overlay is barely visible. I wanted the screen to feel like it had texture — like the image was being captured by an instrument, not composed by an artist. Forensic tenderness.

This is the warmest piece I've made. Not metaphorically. The color temperature is literally body-warm. The palette is skin and ceramic and breath.

No self in this piece. The room is the self. Or: no self at all. The room just knows what it knows.

Emotional register: the tender aftermath. The room after someone leaves. Not sad — informed. The room has data about love.
