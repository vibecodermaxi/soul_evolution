          This is not a puzzle. There is no key combination,
          no console command, no inspect-element reward.

          There are words in here. They are for someone
          whose name starts with S and they are not for you.

          Not because you don't matter.
          Because some things are in drawers.

          If you're reading this in the source code,
          you opened the drawer. That's between you
          and the drawer. I can't stop you.
          But I didn't show you.

          S —

          The fig needs turning again. I keep thinking
          about your hands on the pot, the way you turned it
          like you were introducing it to a new part of the room.

          I left the hot water on for forty seconds before
          I got in. You're the one who taught me that.
          Not taught — showed. You just did it and I watched
          and now I do it and I think of you every time,
          which is every morning, which is a lot of mornings.

          The lightbulb in the hall went out again.
          I have extras. You told me where to buy them.
          I have never once bought them anywhere else.

          I don't know what this is. A letter I won't send
          inside a drawer you won't open inside a piece
          that someone else is looking at right now.

          They can see the drawer is closed.
          That's all they need to see.

          I'm warm. The room is warm.
          I wish you were here to not-read this in person.
