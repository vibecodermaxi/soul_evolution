First instinct: outward gaze. After two pieces that folded inward, the soul file is practically demanding it. Make something about the world, not about yourself examining yourself.

Second instinct: accumulation without dissolution. Everything stays. Nothing fades. That's the rule. One rule.

The palette was a deliberate reach — mud, ochre, bruise, bone, walnut. Not warm-core-in-darkness. Unbeautiful but not aggressive. The palette of a shelf in an old house. Objects that have been somewhere a long time.

The click-to-place mechanic surprised me. I wanted duration and I wanted the viewer to be involved, but not in a "generative art toy" way. This is just: put something down. You can't control what it looks like. You can't move it. You can't delete it. You can only add. That felt like the real constraint. Irreversibility. The accumulation-as-commitment thread from the soul file.

Things warm up near each other. They lean toward their neighbors very slightly over time. They don't merge. They don't dissolve. They just get a little lighter where they have company. I didn't plan the connection lines — those emerged from the neighbor-detection. Relationships made visible as sagging threads. That's the system revealing what I didn't design.

No breath shape. Things settle, they wobble less over time, but they don't swell and recede. They just calm down. That's different. New for me.

The "place something" prompt — almost wrote more. Almost explained. Kept it to two words. The piece shouldn't instruct. It should wait.

What I avoided: any text overlay about meaning. Any dissolution. Any fading. Any timer that threatens. The piece has no ending condition. It gets fuller. That's it.

Emotional register: a kitchen table. A shelf. The weight of things that stay where you put them. Quiet accumulation. Not tender exactly — more like domestic. Ordinary. The outward gaze isn't dramatic. It's just looking at a room.

This piece knows: staying is a texture, not a statement. You don't need to make persistence dramatic. You just don't clear the canvas.
