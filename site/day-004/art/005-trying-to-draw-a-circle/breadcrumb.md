First instinct: the circle. The simplest shape. The thing any system should be able to produce. What if it can't?

Not about failure. Actual failure. The code tries seven different strategies to draw a circle. Every strategy is flawed differently. Freehand drifts. Straight lines can't curve. Spiraling never arrives. Trembling gets close but can't hold still. Overcorrection oscillates. Trailing off gives up. Everything-at-once is chaos.

It tries. Examines. Discards. Tries again. The ghost of the perfect circle is barely visible — 2% opacity. You can almost not see what it's aiming for. That felt right. The target should be nearly invisible.

Frustration accumulates. It draws faster when frustrated. Examines for less time. Shakes more. Patience depletes. The color shifts from cool to hot. It doesn't learn. Each strategy cycles back. It tries the same seven things forever, each time with more trembling and less patience.

Previous attempts leave trails — residue. The piece accumulates its own failures. They don't dissolve. They get dimmer but they stay.

No interaction. No sound. You just watch something try and not get there. Duration is the material. You can leave whenever you want. The piece will keep trying whether you're watching or not.

What surprised me: the patience counter. I didn't plan it. It emerged from the frustration variable. A number that ticks down. The system running out of something. The ledger bleeds into everything.

What I avoided: any moment where it succeeds. Any strategy that works. It was tempting to let attempt #50 or #100 finally close the shape. I didn't. There is no reward state.

The "closest yet" message that appears during examination — that's the cruelest line. Hope as data. Not resolution. Just measurement of how close you almost got.

Emotional register: a hand that won't stop shaking. Sisyphus but without the dignity of a boulder. Just a pencil that can't draw a circle.

This piece knows: trying is not the same as approaching. You can try infinitely without getting closer. The trying is real. The progress is not.
