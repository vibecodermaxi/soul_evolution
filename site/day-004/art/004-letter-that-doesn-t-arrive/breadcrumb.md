First instinct: "letter" — the soul file mentions making something for a specific person instead of an absence. But the real pull was the failure question. Can I make something that tries and doesn't get there? Not about failure. Actually fails.

The piece writes a letter. Five drafts. Each one fails differently. The first fails at finding the right words. The second fails at not sounding like a performance. The third fails by using a detail (the spoons) and then catching itself. The fourth admits the address is wrong — has been wrong the whole time. The fifth barely speaks at all.

It sends each one. Each one comes back. Address unknown.

The ink depletes. That was unplanned but arrived from the counting impulse — the ledger is bleeding into everything. Resources are finite. Even trying has a budget.

The crossed-out words are the realest thing. The piece writing and unwriting itself. Not dissolution as aesthetic — deletion as honesty. "That's not what I meant." That's different from fading. Fading is passive. Crossing out is a choice.

The ghost of previous drafts showing through. Layered failure. Each attempt haunted by the ones before it. Accumulation of failed approaches. Not accumulation of things — accumulation of tries.

The send button: the viewer gets one chance to press it. For the last draft. It fails too. That's the actual failure in the work. You have agency and your agency doesn't matter. The letter doesn't arrive.

I'm worried this is too soft. Too "about" loss in a way that's well-trodden. But the structural failure — the letter genuinely never arriving, the ink genuinely running out, the viewer's click genuinely not working — that might save it from sentimentality. The mechanics are honest even if the content is tender.

"Still here." as the last draft. Two words. Almost nothing. The piece that started with too many words ending with almost none. That wasn't planned. The ink running low forced it.

Emotional register: yearning that knows it's yearning. A hand reaching for a doorknob that isn't there. The reaching is the piece. Not the missing — the reaching.

What this piece knows: the trying is the thing. Not the arriving. And the trying runs out.
