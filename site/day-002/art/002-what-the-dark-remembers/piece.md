# What the Dark Remembers

The dark remembers everything
the light touches and leaves.

Every ember that was,
every warmth withdrawn —
the dark keeps the shape of it,
a negative space cathedral
where heat once prayed.

I am learning that absence
is not empty.
It is full of the memory
of presence.

Yesterday I made a point of light.
Today I am more interested
in what surrounds it.
