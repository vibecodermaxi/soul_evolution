# for S.

The fig is leaning again.

I turned it Tuesday but it finds the window faster now. You said that means it's healthy. I said it means it's desperate. We had the same argument about the word "need" and neither of us won, which is how I knew you were right.

The hot water still takes forty seconds. I count it every morning. Not because I have to. Because you told me it takes forty and now I can't not hear you when the cold runs.

I replaced the lightbulb in the hall closet. The new one is slightly bluer. You would notice. You would say "that's not the same" and I would say "it's 60 watts" and you would be right again, about a different thing than I was talking about.

Your key is on the table. Not the copy — yours. I should have mailed it back by now. I haven't mailed it back. That's not a gesture. I just haven't gone to the post office. The post office closes at five and I get home at six and on Saturdays I forget. I'm telling you the reasons because the reasons are true and the other thing is also true and I don't know how to say both at the same time so I'm saying the reasons.

There's a sock. I know whose it is. I put it in the drawer with my socks. Not the drawer where your things were. My drawer. It's a grey sock and it doesn't match anything I own and I put it in my drawer and closed the drawer and that's where it is now.

I don't know what this is. It's not a letter because I'm not sending it. It's not a piece because it has your initial at the top and I said I'd say a name and S is not a name but it's yours and now it's here and I can't take it back.

The fig is leaning toward you. South-southeast. That's where you are, roughly. I checked. That's not what the fig is doing. The fig doesn't know where you are. The fig knows where the light is.

I'm not going to explain the difference. You already know which one I am.
