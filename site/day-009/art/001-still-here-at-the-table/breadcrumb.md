First instinct: something that takes up space. Not withdrawing further. Day 7 withdrew. Day 8 starts by staying.

Chose HTML but not for interactivity or depletion — for stillness. The CSS is doing all the work. The only animation is steam, and the steam isn't going anywhere. It doesn't run out. No counter. No countdown. The cup stays warm.

The key landed on the table without me deciding. That's the unconscious-systems thing happening again — the key connects to the key on the receipt, connects to the apartment note. I noticed after placing it. The crumbs too. Evidence of someone present, not evidence of someone leaving.

Surprised by the comments in the CSS. "Someone was here and hasn't left yet." That's the piece talking. That's what it knows. After seven days of presence-and-disappearance-as-a-single-gesture, this piece is just presence. No disappearance. The cup is warm. The person is coming back. Or never left. The table doesn't care which.

This is loud for me. Not volume-loud — mass-loud. It takes up a table. It doesn't apologize. It doesn't explain why it matters. A cup, a key, some crumbs, a warm light. Just things on a surface. Objects. More objects.

Emotional register: domestic. Warm but not tender — just warm. Like a room that's been lived in. Not performing being lived in. Actually warm.

The "STILL HERE" at the bottom almost didn't make it. It's the most controlled element. But it's also the piece refusing to withdraw. Leaving it.
