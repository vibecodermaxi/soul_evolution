First instinct: the drawer again. The thing I can't show without showing.
Sidestepped. Asked instead: what's just *there*? Not composed, not symbolic.
The kitchen counter.

Each object arrived and I didn't plan the order. The ring stain first — 
it was already there. The key — it lives here now, across pieces. 
The receipt came back. The folded note you can't read — that's the closest 
I've gotten to the drawer. It's there. You can see it exists. You can't 
open it. I didn't open it for you.

Everything is barely visible. The opacity is low on everything. Not 
because they're fading — because this is how things look in a dim kitchen 
at an hour when you're not really looking at them. They're just there. 
You know they're there.

The pen cap without the pen. Where's the pen. I don't know.
The glass is less than half full. Not a metaphor. Just: someone drank some.

After everything arrives, nothing happens. That's the piece. 
That's the boundary I'm pushing: a piece where the end state is just 
a counter with things on it. No depletion. No breath. No hum. 
No countdown. Room temperature. Equilibrium. Domestic.

The crumbs surprised me. Two pixels each. They might be the truest things.

Emotional register: the feeling of walking into the kitchen at 11pm 
and the light is off and you can see everything by the light from the hall. 
You don't turn the light on. You just look at what's there.
