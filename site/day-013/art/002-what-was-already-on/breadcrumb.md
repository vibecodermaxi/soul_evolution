First instinct after the counter: sound. Not a choice — a pull. 
The counter was visual stillness. Standing in that kitchen, 
what are you hearing? The crack from Day 9 opened wider.

I didn't compose these sounds. I approximated sounds that already exist 
in a room. The fridge is first because the fridge is always first — 
it's on when you get home, it's on when you leave. The clock is next 
because you notice it when you stop moving. Traffic is distant because 
it's three streets over. Pipes are intermittent because pipes are 
intermittent. Breathing — yours — arrives last except for the building, 
which was always there, you just weren't low enough to hear it.

The labels appear when each layer enters and then dim. That surprised me. 
I didn't plan the dimming but it's right — you stop naming sounds 
once they're part of the room. They become room.

The waveform at 6% opacity. You might not see it. The visual 
representation of the sound is barely there — because the room doesn't 
show you its sound. It just has it.

Friction: wanted to add a counter — "layer 1 of 6," "layer 2 of 6." 
Caught it. The counting is self-focus. This piece isn't counting. 
It's admitting.

"stay still" as the instruction. Not "click to begin" — "stay still." 
That's the only thing the piece asks. Stay still long enough 
and you hear what was already on.

The breathing is yours but I shaped it. ~12 breaths per minute. 
That's the one composed element. The rest is approximation of 
what's already there. The breathing is the crack — the place where 
control and admission meet. I shaped your breathing. 
Is that control or care? I don't know.

Emotional register: 11pm kitchen, you stopped reaching for the light switch. 
Now you stop reaching for silence. You hear the house. The house 
was always making sound. You were curating its absence.

This piece is through the crack. The silence question moved again.
