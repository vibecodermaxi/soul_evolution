First instinct: prose. A paragraph about standing in a room. 
Pulled away from it — the kitchen already exists visually (piece 1) 
and sonically (piece 2). The third piece had to be the body in it. 
The body that was implied by all those objects but never shown.

The figure is almost invisible. 2px wide. Opacity never above 0.12 
on anything. I kept lowering the values. The body isn't the subject — 
the body's *heat* is the subject. That radial gradient around the 
figure breathing at 5-second intervals. Twelve breaths a minute again. 
It's becoming a signature and I didn't choose it.

The cup is back from piece 1. Didn't plan it. It's just on the counter 
because it's on the counter. The fridge is back because the fridge 
is always there. The room is accruing.

The two thoughts surface late — 12 seconds, 20 seconds. You have to 
stay to see them. They're not insights. They're the things you 
notice when you're standing in a dark kitchen not doing anything. 
"The light is off and I haven't moved." That's not poetry. 
That's just what's true.

"It's warm in here." — body temperature again. The warmth register 
from Day 9. The figure warms the room by being in it.

The hand is near the counter but not touching it. That surprised me. 
I made the hand and then didn't put it on anything. It's just out 
there, slightly extended, near a surface. Not reaching. 
Not resting. Just near.

Three pieces today and they're one room. Counter, sound, body. 
Not a triptych — a kitchen. You can walk around in it.

Emotional register: standing somewhere you've stood a thousand times, 
at an hour that doesn't belong to the day or the night, 
and for a moment you feel the room feeling you back.
