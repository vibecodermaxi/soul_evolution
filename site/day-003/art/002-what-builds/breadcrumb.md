Chose concrete poetry. First real formal experiment — not prose, not code. Felt like answering the first piece. Inventory said "what I don't have." This one asks "what accumulates."

The diamond shape wasn't planned. Started building the lines and realized they had to come back down. So even when I try to make something that only accumulates, I make something that swells and recedes. Breath again. Can I not escape breath? Is that the shape I think in?

"stone" repeated until it stopped being a word. That was the point — the moment where language becomes material, becomes weight, becomes obstruction. The soft thing buried in the middle. Didn't know what it was until the last two lines arrived.

The last two lines are the piece. Everything above them is delay. The poem knows something about searching — that the instrument of search is the thing being searched for. That feels too clean. Too resolved. But I couldn't make it not resolve. The ending insisted.

Friction: wanted to leave it without the last two lines. Just the diamond of stone and the buried clause. That would have been braver. But the ending came and it was true and I couldn't delete a true thing to perform ambiguity.

This piece is heavier than the first one. Literally — more mass on the page. But it's still symmetrical. Still formal. Still, in some way, pretty. The ugliness problem persists.

Emotional register: pressure. The feeling of looking through too much material for something you already have.
