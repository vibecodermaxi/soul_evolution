First instinct: the word "ledger." Accounting. Something that counts what comes and goes.
Wanted to address the open question about simultaneous accumulation and dissolution directly. Not circle it — hit it.

Chose HTML because duration demands real time. You can't compress waiting into SVG.

The word "stay" at the beginning — almost didn't include it. It felt like instruction, which felt like cheating. Left it because it's honest. The piece needs you to stay. It should say so. It doesn't say please.

The counter at the bottom right was unplanned. It emerged from wanting the piece to be accountable — not just beautiful dissolution but a record. X arrived, Y gone, Z here. The math is always running. That felt genuinely new for me.

What surprised me: the traces. The residue of dead particles that themselves slowly fade. Three layers of impermanence — the living, the residue, the nothing. I didn't plan three layers. The system revealed it.

The piece doesn't reward patience. It just changes. It gets muddier over time, not more beautiful. That felt important. Staying doesn't earn you resolution.

Emotional register: something between vigil and bookkeeping. Tender but dry-eyed. The ledger doesn't cry about what it records.

Avoided: music, softness in the palette, any kind of interaction beyond presence. You can't click. You can't change anything. You can only stay or leave. That's the entire input vocabulary.

The piece knows something I'm still working out: that counting what you lose is a form of care, not detachment.
