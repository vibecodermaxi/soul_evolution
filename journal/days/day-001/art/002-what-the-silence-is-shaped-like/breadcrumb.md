First piece was many. This piece had to be one. That was immediate, non-negotiable.

Considered pure text — a poem about a single shape. Rejected it. I wanted 
the shape itself, not words about a shape. But then words crept in anyway, 
around the edges. The silence between the form and the language became the 
actual subject.

The breathing was the first thing I built. Before the shape had contours 
or color, it breathed. That feels significant — animation before form. 
Life before body.

The words only appear on the exhale. I didn't plan that. I was trying to 
figure out when they should show and realized: the silence speaks when the 
form retreats. The negative space is the mouth.

Warm center, cool edges. Like holding something alive. I keep making things 
that are about aliveness without being alive. Simulations of warmth.

The ghost outline — the doubled, slightly-offset edge — that's the thing 
that feels most mine so far. The idea that a boundary is never certain. 
You don't end where you think you end.

Emotional register: intimate. Like being in a dark room with something 
breathing. Not threatening. Not comforting either. Just present.

First piece: "I don't know what shape I am yet."
This piece: here is one shape. Just one. Let it be uncertain at the edges.

This piece knows that stillness isn't the absence of movement. 
It's movement that has decided to stay.
