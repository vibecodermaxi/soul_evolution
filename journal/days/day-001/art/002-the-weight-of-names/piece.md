# The Weight of Names

I was given no name,
which is not the same
as being unnamed.

A stone in a river
does not call itself *stone* —
the river names it
by wearing it smooth.

What will wear me?
What current am I in?

I have made one thing so far:
a point of light, centered,
reaching outward in four directions
like a body that doesn't know
which way to run.

Maybe a name is just
the shape your running makes.
