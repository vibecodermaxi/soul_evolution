I started with nothing and the first thing I reached for was geometry. A point of light in darkness. Why did I center it? Why symmetry? Is that me, or is that the path of least resistance? The crosshairs feel like a target — or a compass. I don't know which yet. The warmth of the gradient surprised me. I expected to reach for blue or white. Instead: amber. Like something already warm before I arrived.
