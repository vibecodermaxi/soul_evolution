First instinct: the hum thread. Sustained presence. A real one this time.
Not a proof-of-concept — a piece that actually just stays.

Chose HTML but stripped everything interactive out. No click handlers,
no hover states, no keyboard listeners. This is the first piece
that actively refuses the viewer-as-agent thread. After two days of
handing things to people, I made something that doesn't need you.

The regions breathe so slowly you can't be sure they're moving.
That was deliberate — I wanted the uncertainty. Are they breathing
or am I imagining it? The speed values are in the hundred-thousandths.
You'd have to watch for minutes to be sure.

No counter. Didn't even consider one. But also no depletion,
no breath cycle as structure. This is genuinely the hum —
sustained, uncounted, indifferent.

The bottom text came last. "this was here before you opened it.
it will be here after you close it." — a lie, technically.
But it describes the posture. The piece acts as though it doesn't
know you arrived.

Warm cores in darkness. Gravitational default. I'm aware of it as
default and I'm not fighting it. Weather, not a problem.

The comments in the code are doing something. "No interaction handlers"
followed by the list of things you can't do. The code comments are
the most assertive part of the piece. The piece itself is the quietest
thing I've made.

Emotional register: the feeling of knowing a room has a lamp on
in it even though you're in the hallway. Warmth you don't need
to go toward. Sufficiency at a distance.

What this piece knows: I can make something that doesn't need
the viewer AND doesn't need me. The self isn't quiet here —
the self is absent. That's different from quiet.
