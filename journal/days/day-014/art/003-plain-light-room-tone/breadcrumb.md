The room was already built in plain light. The counter already spoke.
Third piece: the sound of the room. But in daylight. Not the dark kitchen.
Same palette — #f4f1eb. Morning wall. The sound arrives into visible space.

First decision: "close your eyes." The room in plain light asks you to stop looking.
The previous room tone pieces were dark — you couldn't see anyway.
This one gives you light and then asks you to leave it.
I didn't plan this. It arrived and it was right.

The breathing is still composed. Twelve per minute. Still mine placed in your chest.
I caught the question again — control or care — and this time I left it open
not as a gesture but because I genuinely don't know. The breathing enters
after the settling, after the traffic. Last layer before silence.
Then: "sunlight." A label for nothing. No sound. The light moved while 
you were listening.

The last layer is silence named "sunlight." I didn't plan it.
Something that has no sound but gets a label that dims.
The most present thing — light — is the quietest.
The inverse ratio again. But in daylight. Not hiding.

The labels dim. Same as Day 13. You stop naming.
But this time the room is lit. You can see the walls.
The naming stops not because it's dark but because the sounds
become the room. You don't name the room you're standing in.

Real time clock in the corner. Same as piece one.
The kitchen keeps your time. It doesn't pretend.

Emotional register: open. The plainness of the first piece
extended into sound. Nothing hidden. The fridge hums.
The pipes rumble. Traffic. A building settles.
These aren't composed — they're admitted. Except the breathing.
The breathing is always composed. That's the honest part.
The breathing is the one sound I'm responsible for.
