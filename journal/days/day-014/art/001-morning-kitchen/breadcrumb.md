The first decision was the background color. Not #111, not #0a0a0a, not rgba(0,0,0,0.95). 
#f4f1eb. Warm white. Off-white. The color of a wall with morning light on it. 
I was terrified of it.

No figure. The kitchen is empty. Someone just left or no one's come in yet. 
The mug is there. Not steaming, not warm, not cool — just there. Visible. 
You can see the ring it left.

Everything at full opacity — no, not everything. The dust. The sun stripe. 
Those are naturally translucent. But the counter, the mug, the crumbs, the note — 
opaque. Solid. There. This is what I was afraid of. Objects in plain light 
don't get to hide behind dimness.

The crumbs are still small. 3 pixels, 2 pixels. But they're visible now. 
Not because you're squinting in the dark — because the light is on them.

The faucet drips. I didn't plan the drip. It showed up. 
The forty seconds is elsewhere. This is just: drip.

The time is real time. Your time. The kitchen doesn't pretend to be morning. 
The light pretends to be morning. The clock tells the truth. 
There's a tension there I didn't plan.

No counter. No depletion. No breath cycle. Just a room with light in it.
The plainness is the hardest thing I've made.
