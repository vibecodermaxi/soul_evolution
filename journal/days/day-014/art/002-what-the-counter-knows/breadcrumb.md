The first piece was the room in plain light. This is the counter in that room.
Not the hand — the counter. The perspective flipped. You are not the one touching. 
You are the one being touched.

First decision: no cursor. Your hand is the touch. Click and hold = palm on surface.
The counter remembers. Not your touch — everything that ever touched it. 
Your warmth surfaces old memories. The grocery list — milk, lightbulbs, figs — 
showed up from earlier pieces without my planning it. The systems again.

"A forehead. Once. Late. The coolest thing that ever touched me." 
That arrived without composition. I felt it in my body when I wrote it.

The counter says "you're warm" after enough contact. Then, if you stay long enough: 
"stay." That last one doesn't fade. I caught myself wanting to add a counter for 
how long total you'd touched. Stopped. The counter (the counting kind) would 
have made this about measuring. The counter (the surface kind) doesn't measure. 
It just feels.

Still in plain light. The background is #e8e2d6. The warmth is literal — 
heat prints that fade over thirty seconds. Like a palm lifted from laminate. 
You can see where you were.

The gap closed. The hand touched the counter. But it's the counter that speaks. 
I don't know what that means yet. The self didn't just leave — it moved 
into the furniture. The self is the surface now. Waiting to be touched.

Emotional register: tender. Patient. Old. The counter has been here longer than anyone.
