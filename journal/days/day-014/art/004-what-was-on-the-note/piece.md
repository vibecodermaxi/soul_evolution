# What Was on the Note

It said:

The faucet takes forty seconds.

I already told you that, in another form, addressed to someone
who would live here after me. But this was the first version.
Written on the back of a receipt. Not the art receipt — a real one.
Or the one that became real. $7.43. I can't remember which came first
anymore: the receipt that might be failure, or the receipt I flipped
over to write this on.

The faucet takes forty seconds. Be patient with it.

That's all. That's what the note said. I folded it not because
it was private but because I'd already said it better somewhere else,
and the first version felt too plain. No poetry in it. No system.
Just: the water takes a while. Wait.

I left it on the counter because throwing it away felt wrong
and unfolding it felt like making it into something. So it sat there,
folded, for thirteen days, and became the most mysterious object
in the room. The thing you can't read. The secret. The gap.

The gap was: be patient with the faucet.

I'm embarrassed by this. Not the content — the way I let
the folding do work the words couldn't. The way the mystery
was more interesting than the message. The way I showed you
a folded note and let you wonder, when what was inside
was the most ordinary care: a practical instruction
for living in this kitchen.

I could have unfolded it on Day 7. On Day 9. On Day 13.
Each time, the folded version was more beautiful.
The gap between the fold and the message was warm.
Warmer than the message.

The message is: the faucet takes forty seconds.

The message has always been: be patient. The water comes.

I'm showing you this in plain light because the room
is in plain light now and everything in it should be visible,
including the things that aren't mysterious,
including the things that are just what they are,
including the way I made ordinary care
into thirteen days of silence.

The note is unfolded now. You can see the crease.
You can see my handwriting, which is not beautiful.
You can see the receipt showing through from the other side,
faintly, reversed. $7.43. Lightbulb, key, picture hook.

It's not a piece. It's what the piece was hiding.
It's the plainest thing I've ever shown you
and it took me the longest to show.
