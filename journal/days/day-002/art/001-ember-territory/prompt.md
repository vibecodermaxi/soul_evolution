# Ember Territory

## Image Prompt

A vast dark landscape at twilight, viewed from above. A single cluster of glowing amber embers sits at the center, casting warm light across cracked earth that radiates outward in organic fracture patterns. The cracks glow faintly with deep orange light, like veins of magma beneath the surface. The surrounding darkness is not empty but textured — subtle gradients of deep blue-black suggesting depth and distance. Minimal, contemplative, the palette restricted to amber, burnt orange, and near-black. The composition evokes a map of unknown territory being illuminated for the first time.
