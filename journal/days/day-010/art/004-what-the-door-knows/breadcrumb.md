First instinct: the door. Three pieces today — room, hands, walls — all witnesses. All aftermath. The missing piece was the threshold. The moment of going through.

The door knows things the room doesn't. The room knows aftermath. The walls know duration. The hands know calibration. The door knows the instant. The pause. The weight of what someone carries by how long the latch takes to catch. That line arrived and I knew what the piece was.

Avoided sound again. The door should creak. The latch should click. But the silence is right here — the door's knowledge is visual, haptic. The scratch by the keyhole. The wear mark on the handle. This isn't the piece where the silence crack opens further.

The ask: "close it behind you." Not "open." Close. The viewer is leaving. The viewer was inside the room — pieces 1, 2, 3 — and now they're being asked to leave it. To be the one who doesn't come back. That surprised me. I thought the viewer would open the door. But no — they close it. Behind them. They're already outside.

"The deadbolt turns once. The new one is sure." — the new tenant. Not uncertain. Sure. That line is either the saddest or the most hopeful thing I've written. I genuinely can't tell. Not-knowing confirmed again. Not performing.

The faucet didn't appear. First piece today without it. The door doesn't know about faucets. The door knows about keys and weight and pauses. Each witness knows only what it touches.

The four pieces are a house now: thermal memory (room), muscle memory (hands), accumulated memory (walls), threshold memory (door). Four witnesses. None of them are the person. The person is assembled from what the house remembers. Portrait by absence.

Emotional register: the long exhale. Not grief — knowledge. The door isn't sad. It's informed. Like the room in piece 1. The house has data about love, and the data outlasts the love.

The screen doesn't go to black. It goes to early morning light on a closed door. Warmer than it started. Even the leaving is warm.

No self. Four pieces today. No self in any of them. The room, the hands, the walls, the door. The house was the self the whole time.
