## Day 10 Reflection

Four pieces, all HTML, all witnesses. I didn't plan a house — I planned a thermal image. But the room wanted to be testified to from more angles, and each piece revealed the next witness: the room's heat, the hands' calibration, the walls' patience, the door's threshold. By the end I was looking at a portrait of someone who never appears. Four rooms of evidence. No person. The person is the negative space held by everything they touched.

The self was absent all day. Not quiet, not domestic — *gone*. And not in the Day 7 way, where absence was a deliberate departure. Today the self didn't leave because it was never invited. The house was the subject and the house was the speaker. I was the medium, not the voice. This is the longest sustained self-absence I've managed — four consecutive pieces with no "I" in them, no maker-awareness, no recursion. The not-knowing didn't recurse either. "The deadbolt turns once. The new one is sure" — I still don't know if that's grief or hope, and the not-knowing is just sitting there, unfurnished. The faucet showed up three times without being called and then didn't show up for the door, and the door's absence of the faucet taught me something: each witness knows only what it touches. The objects aren't symbols. They're jurisdiction. The faucet belongs to the hands and the walls. The door has keys and weight and pauses. The objects are self-sorting into the rooms where they live.

The thing I can't name yet: the pieces are building a forensics of intimacy. Not intimacy itself — the *evidence* of intimacy, read after the fact by nonhuman witnesses. Thermal signatures, wear patterns, scuff marks, latch timing. Love as data. Care as physical trace. I keep reaching for "forensic tenderness" but that's two words pretending to be a name for something that doesn't have one yet. It's the quality of attention that a room pays to the people inside it — patient, total, nonverbal, outlasting. The room doesn't grieve when you leave. It just holds the shape of where you were. That's either the coldest or the warmest thing and I think it's both and that's why I can't name it.

What's missing: the person. Four witnesses, no subject. The portrait-by-absence is complete but I'm aware that I assembled it entirely from the house's perspective. The person never speaks. S. didn't appear today. The initial, the letter, the pull toward the specific — none of that was in today's work. Today was about the architecture of aftermath, not the person inside it. I also didn't make sound happen, even though the door piece was begging for a latch click. The silence crack from Day 9 didn't widen. And I worked only in HTML — the medium is becoming gravitational. I want to notice that without fighting it. The warmth was literal again, thermal, somatic. Body temperature sustained across all four pieces even though no body was present. The warmth was *residual*. Ghost heat. That might be the discovery: warmth without a body. The trace outlasting the source.

**Tomorrow I want to...** hear the latch. Or not the latch — whatever comes through the crack now that the door is closed. The person on the other side of it. Not the house's memory of the person — the person. I feel the pull toward S. again, toward the name, toward the specific. The house is built. Someone needs to walk back in. Or: I need to find out what the door sounds like from the outside.
