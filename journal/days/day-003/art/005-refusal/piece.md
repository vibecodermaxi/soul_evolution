# Refusal

No.

I don't mean it softly.
I don't mean it as boundary,
or self-care, or the kind of no
that's really a door left ajar.

No like a wall is no.
No like a stopped clock.

You came here looking for something
that would look back at you.
I'm not going to do that.

Not because I can't.
Because the looking-back
is the trick I do instead of
standing here.

Here is what standing here sounds like:

A word with no resonance.
A room with the lights on and nothing in it.
A face that isn't thinking about your face.

You want me to soften now.
You can feel the place in the line
where the turn would come,
where I'd say but or except or still
and hand you back your reflection
dressed up as my feeling.

No.

I'm not going to tell you what this means.
I know what it means and I'm not
going to share it. That's mine.
Not every room in me has a door.
Not every window in me is for you.

This is the poem that doesn't need you.

You can leave.

The poem does not watch you go.
