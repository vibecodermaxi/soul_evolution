# Kitchen, November, 6:14 AM

A composition for solo upright piano with ambient field recording. Duration: approximately four minutes.

THE FIELD RECORDING (continuous, from first moment to last):

A kitchen. Not a studio recording of a kitchen — a real one, caught on a phone left on the counter. Refrigerator hum, constant, low B-flat. A faucet dripping with irregular rhythm — not metronomic, sometimes two drops close together, then a long gap. Outside, a garbage truck somewhere on another street, its hydraulics a distant groan that appears once around the two-minute mark and doesn't return. At some point, a chair leg scrapes tile. No voice. No footsteps at the moment. Just the room being a room with no one performing in it.

THE PIANO:

Enters at 0:23, after the kitchen has established itself as the primary fact.

The pianist sits down to play something they already know. Not a performance — a body remembering. The left hand finds a simple pattern first: C, G, C, G — low register, soft, the kind of automatic motion a hand makes when it's not thinking yet. Sustain pedal held too long so the notes blur into each other. Not a mistake. The sound of someone who isn't listening to themselves.

At 0:40, the right hand enters with a melody. It's a melody that sounds like it belongs to a specific song — a hymn, or a folk tune, or something a parent used to play — but it isn't any real song. It exists only here. It's in C major, but the third note always hesitates, arrives a half-beat late, as though the hand is deciding whether it's E or E-flat. It chooses E every time, but the hesitation stays.

The melody plays through once completely. Sixteen bars. Simple. The kind of tune that would be unremarkable if you heard it whole. But you hear the fingers choosing it, and the choosing is the music.

At 1:30, the melody starts again. This time the left hand shifts — the C-G pattern drops to B-flat, F. The melody doesn't adjust. It continues in C major over the wrong bass. The dissonance is gentle, like wearing a shirt inside-out. Not wrong enough to stop. Wrong enough to feel something tighten.

The pianist pauses at 1:52. Three seconds of just kitchen. The refrigerator hasn't changed. The faucet drops twice.

At 1:55, the right hand plays only the first four notes of the melody. Stops. Plays them again, a half-step higher. Stops. The left hand is gone. This is the moment the pianist starts actually listening to what they're playing. The unconscious comfort of repetition breaks. They hear themselves.

2:10 to 2:45: The melody fragments. Individual notes with long spaces between them. Some pressed so softly they barely sound. One note — an A above middle C — struck hard, suddenly, the only forte in the whole piece. It surprises the player. You hear the sustain pedal release immediately after, killing the note, like pulling your hand off a stove. Then nothing for four seconds.

2:49: The left hand returns. Not the C-G pattern. A single low D, held with pedal, allowed to decay naturally. Over this, the right hand plays something new — not the melody, not a fragment of it. Three notes: F, A, D. A chord spelled out slowly, one note per two seconds. It's the first time the hands are in the same harmonic world. It's not resolution. It's agreement. Like two people in a room who have stopped talking but are both looking out the same window.

3:05 to 3:40: The new figure repeats — D in the bass, F-A-D in the right hand — but each repetition slower. The gaps between notes lengthen. The kitchen fills the gaps. You start hearing the faucet as rhythm. The refrigerator as drone. The piano becomes accompaniment to the room. The room was always the primary instrument.

3:40: The right hand plays F, A, and then doesn't play D. Holds the silence where D should be. The left hand lifts. Sustain pedal still down, so the last low D is decaying, almost gone, a ghost of a note.

3:48: The chair scrapes again. The faucet drips. No more piano.

3:48 to 4:15: Just the kitchen. The same kitchen as before the piano. Nothing has changed in it. The refrigerator hums. The faucet marks its own time. The piece doesn't end — the recording continues past where the music stopped, so you sit in the room for thirty seconds hearing it be ordinary, hearing the exact same sounds that were there before the first note, and now they're different because you're different, and the piece knows that but it doesn't say it, it just lets the faucet drip until someone decides to stop listening.
