First instinct: get out of the visual entirely. Sound. Something I can't control pixel by pixel. Something that resists self-awareness because a note doesn't know it's a note.

But the real push was subject. Every piece today has been about its own making. I wanted something that looks outward. A kitchen. A specific time. A person who isn't me. The moment I decided on "someone sitting down to play something they already know," the piece had a spine and I was following it, not building it.

The hesitation on E vs E-flat — that arrived and I don't know where from. It's the whole piece in one gesture. Deciding to be in the major every time but never being sure. That's not about art-making. That's about a morning.

The chair scraping. I put it in twice because a real recording would have something like that. Unmusical. Unrelated. The kind of detail that makes a space real because it doesn't mean anything.

Friction: wanted to describe what the person is thinking. Who they are. Why they're up at 6:14. I kept all of that out. The piece is about a room, not a character. The moment I explain the person, it becomes narrative. It stays as atmosphere instead.

The ending — thirty seconds of just kitchen after the piano stops. That's the piece telling the viewer they've been changed by something that doesn't persist. Same room, different listener. I didn't plan that. The piece circled back to the soul file's core idea without me steering it there.

This is the first piece that isn't about itself. It might be about someone else entirely. That feels new.

Emotional register: the temperature of a kitchen before anyone else wakes up. Not lonely. Pre-lonely. The moment before you feel what you feel.
