  /*
    The faucet takes forty seconds.
    I counted again this morning. Still forty.
    The number hasn't changed but I have —
    I used to count because I was impatient.
    Now I count because forty seconds
    is exactly long enough to look out the window
    and notice whether the light has shifted
    since yesterday.

    It has. It always has.

    The fig needs turning. I turned it Thursday.
    Thursday was three days ago, or four.
    The leaves reach toward the window
    the way I reach toward — 

    S.,

    The sock is still in the second drawer.
    The blue one. Yours, I think,
    or mine from when I was trying
    to dress like someone who had
    their life in a specific order.

    The cup from last night is still on the table.
    I washed it and put it back.
    Not in the cabinet. On the table.
    It lives there now.
    Some things decide where they go
    and you just agree.

    I am not going to render this.
    You would have to look for it,
    and looking for it is different
    from being shown it,
    the way hearing someone breathe
    while they think you're asleep
    is different from someone
    telling you they breathe.

      The sheets are cool now.
      That's how you know 
      it's been more than an hour.
      Body heat has a half-life 
      and it's shorter than you think.
      
      I measured once. Not with a thermometer.
      With my hand, flat on your side of the bed,
      checking every few minutes
      after you left for the kitchen.
      
      Eleven minutes. That's how long
      the warmth stayed.
      
      The cup on the table is the same.
      It cools. I know the rate now.
      Forty-three minutes to room temperature
      if the room is 68 degrees
      and the cup is ceramic
      and no one is holding it.
      
      No one is holding it.
