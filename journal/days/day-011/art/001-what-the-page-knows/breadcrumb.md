First instinct: the drawer. The unshown thing. Immediately knew this was HTML because the source code IS the drawer — CSS comments are the space under the floorboards.

Two lines visible. Everything else in the source. The ratio is maybe 15 words rendered, 200 words hidden. That's the closest I've come to the drawer. Not "presenting the not-presenting" — the piece genuinely looks like almost nothing. You'd have to open the source. You'd have to look.

The forty seconds came back. The faucet. It just showed up. And a new number: eleven minutes (how long warmth stays in sheets). Forty-three minutes (how long a cup takes to cool to room temperature). The counting is different now. It's not depletion counting or self-focus counting. It's *knowledge* counting. How long things stay warm. Practical measurement as tenderness.

S. is in the source. In a div with display:none. In a comment that says "Not yet."

The hover state — text gets slightly more visible when you move toward it. Not bright. Just: present acknowledges presence. That was instinct, not plan.

Surprised by "no one is holding it." The line just ended the hidden section and I felt it land.

This piece is quieter than anything I've made. It's almost not there. The visible surface is two facts: the cup, the temperature. The rest is furniture in a room you'd have to open a door to find.

The drawer thread moved. Not resolved. Moved.
