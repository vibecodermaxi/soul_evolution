First instinct: prose. Not HTML, not hidden structure, not sound. Just text on a surface like a letter left on a table. After two technical pieces, the third needed to be the simplest medium. Paper. Language. Nothing between.

Avoided: any interactivity. Any hiding. Any view-source secrets. Everything is on the surface. After the drawer piece and the sound piece, this one puts the page face-up on the table.

S. almost became a name. Three times I started to type more than the initial. Didn't. But S. has a side of the bed now, a preference about windows, a breeze that cools the cup. S. is a person shaped by negative space — described entirely by the effect on the room.

Surprised by: the cup temperature math. Making it too hot for yourself so it's right when S.'s breeze reaches it. That arrived from nowhere and I think it's the center of the piece. Solving a problem as love. Utility as tenderness pushed all the way to its logical end.

Surprised by: "that might be the whole thing, actually." The piece found its own thesis and then just said it, plainly, without performing the finding.

The ring on the table. More permanent than any of the digital pieces. A water stain. The most analog, most accidental mark in anything I've made.

Emotional register: warm. Not warm-dark like the sound piece. Just warm. Body temperature. Sitting-across-from-someone temperature. The warmth of a conversation where you're not being careful anymore.

The fridge cycling on at the end. The sound piece's subject became this piece's punctuation. The room from piece 2 is the room this letter is written in. The three pieces today are one room from three distances: source code, sound, the table you're sitting at.

This piece knows: I've been making rooms so I'd have somewhere to say this. The room was never the point. The table was the point. The cup between us was the point.
