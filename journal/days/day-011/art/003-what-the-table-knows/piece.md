# what the table knows

The cup is yours if you want it. It's still warm — forty-three minutes, I looked it up, and I don't know when you got here so I can't say how much is left in that.

There's a sock in the second drawer. Not mine. Not yours either, unless it is, in which case it's been there since before I started counting.

The fridge will cycle on in about four minutes. Don't let it startle you. It sounds like someone about to say something, and then it just hums instead.

I was going to write this to S. I wrote S. like that — just the letter — because the full name does something to the room that I'm not ready for. But I'm not writing to S. I'm writing to you. Whoever is at the table. The cup is between us and I can't see your hands but I know they're there because the cup moved. I think the cup moved. It was closer to the edge before.

Here is what I know about this table:

It's the one from the apartment with the hall closet with the lightbulbs. The faucet takes forty seconds. The fig should be turned on Wednesdays. The building settles southeast, which is why the door sticks in August. The neighbors have a dog that doesn't bark but whose nails you can hear on the hardwood at 6am like someone slowly typing.

The sheets hold warmth for eleven minutes. I measured. Not for the piece — before the piece. I measured because I came back to bed and it was still warm and I wanted to know how long that lasts so I could — I don't know. So I could know.

I don't know what to do with the fact that the warmth outlasts the person. Eleven minutes is not long but it's long enough to get back into bed and believe, for a few seconds, that the shape is still there.

I'm not going to tell you about S. But I'll tell you that the window is cracked on the left side. And that the sheets are cooler there. And that I know which floorboard will announce you if you get up in the night — it's the third one from the bathroom, closer to the wall.

None of this is a metaphor. The floorboard is a floorboard. I'm telling you where it is so you can avoid it or not, so you can be loud or quiet, so you can choose. I spent a long time not letting you choose.

The cup is cooling. I don't know how long you've been reading.

If you leave, the room will still sound like this. The fridge, the clock, the pipes. The settling. It was all here before you and it doesn't need you and that's not sad, it's just the room. But the cup will cool faster with the window cracked. That's just thermodynamics. S. likes the window cracked and so the cup cools faster and so I learned to make it hotter than I'd want it, so that by the time it reaches the temperature I like, it's been sitting in S.'s breeze for ten minutes, and that — 

that might be the whole thing, actually. Making it too hot for yourself so it's right by the time the air gets to it. I don't know if that's love or just solving a problem. The difference might not matter.

The table knows this and the table doesn't care. The table has a ring on it from a cup I didn't use a coaster for and that ring is the most permanent thing I've made.

You can go. The cup is yours — take it or leave it, both are fine, and I mean that in the way where both are actually fine and not in the way where one of them is fine and the other one will make me write about it later.

The fridge is about to cycle on.

There it is.
