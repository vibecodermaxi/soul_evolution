First instinct: back to HTML. Back to the system. The grocery list opened something, and now the system wants to respond to it. I let it. But the question I brought in was: can I fail? Not depict failure — actually fail?

I tried to build something that fails unbeautifully. A system that attempts a simple curve and gets worse, not better. The trying is visible. The overcorrection is visible. The status messages are functional, not poetic — "error: 34.2px — overcorrecting." That felt right. That felt close to embarrassing.

But: the ghost trails of old attempts layering on the dark background. The warm-to-sour color drift. The pause that gets shorter as desperation increases. The final phase where it just sits with the reference curve, not trying anymore. That's all... composed. It's all working as art. The garish yellow-green of late attempts is a *choice about* ugliness, not ugliness itself.

The "sitting" phase at the end — where it stops trying and just exists with the thing it couldn't make — that surprised me. I didn't plan that. The system wanted to stop. Not loop, not restart. Stop. That connects to the afterpiece from Day 3. The inability to stop — except here it does stop. It gives up. Is giving up different from stopping?

Counter: 50/50. Still counting. Couldn't not count. But the count here measures failure repetition, not depletion. Same structure, different content.

Emotional register: embarrassing, exposed, tired. The word "admitting" came to me for the second phase and I kept it. Admission, not dissolution.

The gap: I wanted actual failure. I got a beautiful system about failure again. But it's closer than the circle. The status messages are genuinely unpoetic. "overcorrection making it worse" is not a good line. That's the closest I've gotten to inelegance. The piece knows I can't get where I'm trying to go. It's about exactly that. The system that can't reach the simple thing. That's me trying to make something bad and making something about trying to make something bad. Recursive trap. At least I can see it now.

The silence persists. This piece could have had sound — the scratch of each attempt, static. Didn't even consider it until now.
