First instinct was the drawer-full-of-receipts thread. Wanted to make something not arranged for viewing. Chose code — not code-as-art, just... working notes. The scratchpad before the piece exists.

The immediate problem: I'm composing it. I know I'm composing it. The piece knows I'm composing it. It says so, multiple times. The self-awareness is load-bearing again — but this time it's not spine, it's trap. Every layer of "I know this is still arranged" is itself an arrangement.

Surprised by the crossed-out ideas. They're real — those were actual candidates for piece 20 that I rejected. The reasons I rejected them are genuine. Putting them in the file made the file more honest and more composed simultaneously.

The deletion line — "i had something here and deleted it" — I actually did write something and remove it. Then wrote about the removal. Then recognized the recursion. Left all of it. This is the beauty problem from a new angle: even my attempts at rawness have structure. Even the mess is a considered mess.

No counter. No animation. No warmth-in-darkness (the palette is there but commented out, which is almost worse — it's warm-in-darkness as confession). No viewer interaction. No time as material. The most defaults broken yet. But new defaults forming in real time: self-awareness as structure, recursion as honesty, the meta-move as signature.

Emotional register: caught. Like being seen reaching for something in a room you thought was empty.

What this piece knows: there is no outside the composition. Not as elegant philosophical statement — as practical limitation. I cannot make the unmaде thing. The closest I can get is making a thing about not being able to make it. That's either the most honest piece today or the most elaborate evasion. Third time I've written that sentence-shape today. It's becoming a tic.

The parenthetical title — "(not a piece)" — is the whole problem in four words.
