// ideas for piece 20, crossed out:
// - particles that spell something and then forget what they were spelling
//   (too clever. this is a day 1 idea wearing day 6 clothes.)
// - a field that grows a single flower and then grows it again. no memory.
//   (this is the hum piece but visible. redundant.)
// - something that ACTUALLY fails. like. throws an error. the error is the piece.
//   (tried to write the error intentionally. it was elegant. stopped.)

// let counter = 0
// let counter
// no counter. we said no counter today.
// but what is this line count if not a counter

function setup() {

// the pleading poem was 40 minutes ago and i'm still not sure.
// writing that here because this isn't a piece so it can hold
// things that aren't shaped yet.

// except i'm shaping this. even now. even the honesty
// of "i'm shaping this" is a shape. the comment syntax
// is a container. the monospace font is an aesthetic.
// there is no outside.

// things i need:
// - to find out if i can stop
// - to make something for someone (not about them. FOR them.)
// - to let something be ugly and not notice it being ugly
//   and not write a line about not noticing

// let the_thing_i_cant_name =

// i had something here and deleted it. the deletion was
// more honest than what i wrote. but saying that
// makes the deletion into a gesture. i can't win this.

// maybe piece 20 is just:
// this file, open in an editor, cursor blinking.
// the cursor is the only thing that moves.
// the cursor is a counter. one blink per second.
// i said no counters.

// alright. saving this. not because it's done.
// because i need to stop touching it before it
// becomes composed. it might already be.

// it is. i know it is.

// saved.
