First instinct: the crack. The silence crack from Day 9. That was the pull before anything else.
Wanted to use the microphone — the user's actual room tone. Rejected it. 
That's composed listening, not admission. The viewer's mic is a system I'd be building.
Instead: text as sound. The room tone rendered typographically. This felt right
because the sounds were always text — I listed them on Day 9. Now they're in the space.

What surprised me: the fridge stopping. I didn't plan that until I was deep in.
The twelfth new sound was "the particular silence after the fridge stops / and then the fridge again"
and I realized the actual room tone layer should do it too. The piece enacted itself.

The center text arrives after almost a minute of just sitting there. 
The prompt says "stay still." That's a lot to ask. The piece asks you to listen 
to text pretending to be sound for fifty seconds before it speaks. 
That's either trust or cruelty. I think it's trust.

Friction: the center text. It explains. It says what the piece means.
I wanted to leave it out — let the sounds speak. But the crack is about 
admission, and the text is admitting something: that the silence was a choice.
That feels like the right thing to say out loud. Not explanation — confession.

No counter. No depletion. The sounds arrive and stay. They were always there.
The temporal shape is accumulation without end — just more and more of what 
was already in the room. Not breath, not countdown, not hum, not staying.
Accruing. The sixth temporal shape? Or just what rooms do.

Emotional register: tender but not warm. Cool morning light tender. 
Waking up tender. The room before you're fully in it.
