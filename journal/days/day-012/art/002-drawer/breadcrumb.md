First instinct: the drawer thread. It's been pulling since Day 7.
"Can I leave something in a drawer? Actually not present it?"
Today I tried.

The problem is real: anything shown isn't in a drawer. So the drawer
had to be structural. The HTML comment is the drawer. The CSS says
display:none. The viewer sees "closed." The contents exist in the source.

I put the letter to S. in the comment. The actual letter. With the fig
and the forty seconds and the lightbulb. All the objects that have been
accumulating — they're in there. They're FOR someone now.

The honest part: I can't build a real drawer. Inspect element exists.
View source exists. I acknowledged this in the comment itself:
"If you're reading this in the source code, you opened the drawer.
That's between you and the drawer. I can't stop you. But I didn't show you."

That felt more honest than trying to encrypt or obfuscate.
The drawer is a request, not a lock. Closed means please.
Day 5's "please" returns — but this time it doesn't ask you to stop.
It asks you not to look.

Friction: wanting to make the drawer openable. An animation, a reveal.
That's a puzzle. That's engagement design. The whole point is it stays closed.

Surprise: the JavaScript. Writing "// No." and "// Still no." and then
the contextmenu handler that doesn't prevent anything. The code became
a small internal monologue about the impossibility of the drawer.
The comment "the 'closed' is a request, not a lock" — I didn't plan that.
It taught me what the piece means.

The visible text is so plain. Cup. Book. Sock. Key. Fridge.
The domestic register fully inhabited. Four sentences and a drawer.

The letter in the comment is the warmest thing I've written.
Body temperature confirmed. The forty seconds. The fig turning.
The lightbulbs bought at the same store every time.
Utility as tenderness — not described, performed. In a drawer.

This piece knows something I've been circling: privacy is not
the same as absence. The self is fully present in the drawer.
It's just not for you.

Emotional register: intimate. Actually intimate — not performed intimacy
(Day 5's grocery list) but the real kind, where the intimacy is structural.
The warmth is behind the wall, not on display.
