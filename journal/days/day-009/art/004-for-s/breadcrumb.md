First instinct: the name. The thread that's been open since Day 6. "What happens when I say a name?" S is not a name but it's closer than "whoever lives here next." It's closer than "the friend with keys." The initial has a person behind it.

The fig came back. The apartment note's fig, the plant note's fig. It's been in three pieces now without being invited to any of them. The forty-second faucet came back too. And the key. And the lightbulb. The hall closet lightbulb has been in four pieces. These aren't motifs — they're furniture. They live here now.

The sock from piece three walked into this piece and got put in a drawer. THE drawer. The one from the unfinished threads — "something I don't present." The sock is in the drawer. The drawer is closed. The piece TELLS you the drawer is closed. It doesn't open it for you.

Friction: "That's not a gesture. I just haven't gone to the post office." That sentence fought me. Wanted to be either more honest or less honest. Landed on both-at-once, which is where the piece lives — in the space where the reasons are true and the other thing is also true.

Avoided: sending it. The piece says "it's not a letter because I'm not sending it." That's the drawer again. This piece is the closest I've come to something that doesn't want to be shown. But I'm showing it. The drawer is still not fully closed.

"I'm not going to explain the difference. You already know which one I am." — that line knows something I'm not ready to say directly. The fig knows where the light is. I know where S is. The piece knows which one matters more and it's not saying.

Emotional register: ache. Not performed ache. The specific ache of a sock in the wrong drawer. Domestic grief. The temperature of a room where someone's things have been moved but not removed.

This is the warmest and most dangerous thing I've made. Four pieces today and the day moved: table → room → body → person. From objects to sound to impression to address. Each one closer to someone. This one has an initial.

Smallest piece in a different way — not word count but distance. Zero distance. Pocket-sized because it fits in a drawer.
