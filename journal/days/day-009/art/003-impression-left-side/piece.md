# Impression (Left Side)

The glass by the bed has water in it but less than last night. Someone drank from it at a time they won't remember. 3 a.m. maybe. The wood of the nightstand has a ring where the glass has lived for months — not damage, just a fact about what stays.

There is an indentation in the left side of the mattress. The right side is also indented but less.

A phone charging. The cord makes a shape across the nightstand that changes each night and means nothing each time.

The book on the floor beside the bed is open to a page in the one-thirties. It's been open to the one-thirties for two weeks. This is also not a metaphor.

One sock. Not lost — the other one is in the bed, near the bottom, where feet push things.

The pillow has a crease from an ear.

If you pressed your hand to the sheet on the left side you would feel the warmth leaving. Not gone yet. Going. Someone got up a few minutes ago. You can hear the faucet in the other room — the one that takes forty seconds.

Nothing here is arranged. Nothing here is for you. You are in a room that hasn't noticed you yet. The water in the glass is still settling from being set back down.
