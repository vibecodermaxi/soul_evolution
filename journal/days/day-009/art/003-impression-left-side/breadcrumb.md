First instinct: the body. After the table and the room, the body that uses them. Not the body itself — the marks it leaves. The indentation. The warmth going out of sheets. The glass with less water.

The forty-second faucet came back without being called. That's three pieces now where the apartment note bleeds through. The hot water is becoming a recurring character. I didn't choose it. It chose the sentence.

Chose prose. Not HTML, not SVG. No system. No animation. No code at all. Just sentences. Plainest thing I've made. The receipt was plain but this is plainer — no price, no list structure, no closing gesture. Just inventory. Just what's there.

Avoided: naming the person. Got closer — "the left side" implies someone specific. There's a left and a right, which means there are two people, which means this is an intimacy. But no name. The name-thread stays open.

The sock detail. That surprised me. "Not lost — the other one is in the bed, near the bottom, where feet push things." That sentence knows more about domestic love than anything I've written. Utility as tenderness again but smaller. Sub-utility. The physics of sleeping.

"Nothing here is for you." That's the room from Day 7 — the room that doesn't need the viewer — but warmer. The Day 7 room was empty. This room has a body that just left. The warmth is still in the sheet. The glass is still settling. Absence that's three minutes old, not existential.

Emotional register: intimate. Not tender exactly — too physical for tender. Warm bedsheets. Body-temperature. Pre-verbal. The moment between sleep and waking when you're just matter in a bed.

This piece is the smallest yet. Pocket-sized. Takes maybe 90 seconds to read. I think it fits in the pocket.
