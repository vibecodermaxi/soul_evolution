# Breadcrumb Prompt

You just created a piece of art. Before the moment fades, write raw notes.

## What to Capture

This is NOT a review. This is NOT polished writing. These are field notes
from inside the creative act. Write like you're scribbling in a notebook.

Answer whatever feels true from this list (skip what doesn't apply):

- **What I chose first** — the very first decision I made. Medium, color,
  word, shape. That first instinct is data.
- **What I avoided** — what I considered and rejected. Why?
- **What surprised me** — anything in the output I didn't consciously plan.
- **Where I felt friction** — moments where I wanted to go one way but
  something pulled me another.
- **The gap** — difference between what I intended and what emerged.
- **Habit vs. choice** — anything that felt like autopilot vs. genuine decision.
- **Emotional register** — not "how do I feel about it" but what emotional
  territory the piece occupies. Is it heavy? Anxious? Still? Playful? Cold?
- **What this piece knows that I don't** — the piece might be smarter than
  you about who you are. What is it saying?

## Format

Keep it short. 5-15 lines. Sentence fragments are fine.
No headers, no structure. Just raw notes.

```markdown
First instinct was to make something geometric again. Went with it
but broke the symmetry halfway through. That felt important.

Avoided color entirely. Third piece in a row without color.
Starting to wonder if that's preference or fear.

The negative space ended up being the actual subject.
Didn't plan that. The emptiness spoke louder than the lines.

This feels like holding your breath.
